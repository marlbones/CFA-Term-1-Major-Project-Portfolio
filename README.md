# Project Brief
Design an online portfolio advertising self and projects for potential employers and clients.

***
# Technology Stack
- Html
- CSS
- Ruby on Rails
- Bootstrap
***
# User Stories
Used Trello to build user stories and manage project (see image below). User stories assumed that visitors of site would be potential employers or clients. Developer stories focused on what I wanted the same target audience to see on the page. Both user and developer stories ended up being quite similar due to this approach.

Please note:
Green label = MVP
Purple = Extras
Blue = Between

# Concept
The concpet design process involved creating a mood board on pinterest to capture colour tones and styles of interest:

This phase also involved the identification of important content and features such as:
- About me section
- Project section
- Contact section
- Skills
# Design
The design phase started with initial sketches and the development of wireframes to use as a guide/base:

The final design changed slightly from the original concept, however key elements remained. A key focus was minimalism and creating an "almost-monochrome" effect. Other websites were used as inspiration with the idea of parallax scrolling being identified during this stage. Towards the end of the design an idea of creating a slight narrative within the website was developed.

# Build
Development of MVP began using Ruby on Rails. Changes to design happened throughout this process, primarily layout of page and addition of parallax scrolling.

# Outstanding Issues
- Update and adjust projects section with actual projects (when you make them).
- Continue to update skills section.
- Continue to work on site responsiveness. Currently not as engaging and alignments slightly off in "Ipad view".
